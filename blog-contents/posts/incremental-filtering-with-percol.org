#+TITLE: Making `| grep` Obsolete: Incremental Filtering with Percol
#+TAGS: shell
#+PERMALINK: incremental-filtering-with-percol

* What you get
- Faster, easier workflow of selecting lines from stdin
- Unlocked potential of making your shell life easier

* What is percol?
[[https://github.com/mooz/percol][Percol]] gets input from a file or stdin, let you filter lines incrementally, and output selected lines to stdout. For vim users, it's [[https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim][unite.vim]] for stdin. For emacs users, it's [[http://emacs-helm.github.io/helm/][Emacs Helm]] (previously anything.el) for stdin. For zsh users, it's [[https://github.com/zsh-users/zaw][zaw]] for stdin. For shell lovers, it's incremental =| grep=. For others, watch this:

#+BEGIN_HTML
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://asciinema.org/a/7258.js" id="asciicast-7258" async></script>
#+END_HTML

What's great about percol is that it interacts with stdio, so it's easy to combine percol with other programs to accomplish many tasks.

* Setup
You can install percol using pip: =pip install percol=.

I recommend you to take a look at [[https://github.com/mooz/percol#configuration][percol README configuration section]]. But if you are busy, just make =~/.percol.d/rc.py= and write this to get nice keymaps:

#+BEGIN_HTML
<code data-gist-id='8501936'></code>
#+END_HTML

* Examples
If you are using zsh, this zsh history search is the must:

#+BEGIN_HTML
<code data-gist-id='8501974'></code>
#+END_HTML

* What's next?
Sky is the limit! You can make many tasks easier. When you use =| grep= in interactive shell, maybe you can replace it with percol.

Here are some more examples to spark your creativity: you can instantly checkout on your desired git branch (~alias gbs="git branch | percol | xargs git checkout"â€‹~), or you can use percol to [[https://github.com/Genki-S/dotfiles/blob/master/zshfiles/rcfiles/percol.zsh#L11-L30][select clipboard history]] (you need Mac and [[http://www.clipmenu.com/][ClipMenu]]).
